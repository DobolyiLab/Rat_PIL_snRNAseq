# Inhibition of Aggression by Social Touch — Rat PIL snRNA-seq

This repository contains R code for subclustering and annotation of neurons from rat posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL) single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data. The analysis covers preprocessing/QC, integration and clustering, neuron subclustering, marker visualization, and CellChat-based cell–cell communication summaries. Figures are saved in TIFF and PDF formats to comply with journal requirements.

*Abstract:* TBD (manuscript in preparation).

**One-sentence summary:** Social touch–activated PIL neurons project to the MPOA and acutely inhibit aggression; chemogenetic/optogenetic manipulation confirms causality.

## Raw Data

- **Raw FASTQ** files and **10x feature–barcode matrices** for this study will be deposited to **NCBI GEO**: **GSEXXXXXX** (to be provided).


Until accessions are assigned, place local 10x outputs under `data/raw/<sample>/outs/` (see below). These paths are ignored by Git and will not be uploaded.
